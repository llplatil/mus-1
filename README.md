# MUS1: Mouse Behavior Analysis Tool

A Python-based tool designed to streamline the analysis of mouse behavior data.

## Overview

MUS1 takes the CSV tracking files and arena images from your DeepLabCut projects and makes it easy to:
1. Visualize mouse movement patterns
2. Experiment with different analysis parameters
3. Batch process multiple experiments using optimized settings

The project uses a "subjects/" directory structure to organize mouse-specific data.

## Current Focus (v0.1.0)

The initial version focuses on creating a smooth workflow where users can:
- Drop in DeepLabCut-processed tracking files (CSV)
- Import corresponding arena images
- Visually explore movement patterns
- Test different analysis approaches through the Methods Explorer
- Apply successful analysis parameters across multiple experiments with multiple mouse IDs

## Requirements
- Processed DeepLabCut project files (tracking CSVs)
- Arena images from your experiments
- Python 3.10+


## Project Status
Currently in early development. See our [Development Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for details.

## Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Future Goals
- Automated arena detection
- Integrated video playback
- Additional behavior analysis modules
- Automated parameter optimization

## Getting Started
Coming soon! The project is currently in active development.
