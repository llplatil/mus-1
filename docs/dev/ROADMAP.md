# MUS1 Roadmap

This roadmap shows current status and planned development priorities. Items are prioritized by impact and risk.


## Known Issues
- Legacy GUI components need migration to clean architecture
- Windows/Linux video scanners lack OS-specific optimizations
- Some plugins need migration to new service pattern

## Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. **GUI Migration**: Update GUI components to use clean architecture
2. **Plugin Migration**: Migrate existing plugins to new service pattern
3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove redundant DTOs and unused code

### Medium Priority
1. **Scanner Improvements**: OS-specific video scanners for Windows/Linux
2. **Remote Processing**: SSH-based worker execution and scanning
3. **Advanced Features**: Distributed processing and job orchestration

## Future Features

### Remote Processing & Scanning
- SSH-based worker execution
- Remote video scanning across networks
- Shared storage integration
- Cross-platform deployment automation
