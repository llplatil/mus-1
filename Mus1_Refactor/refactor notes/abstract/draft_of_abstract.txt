Title:
Mus1: An Open-Source GUI-Based Tool for Enhanced Reproducibility and Scalability in Mouse Behavioral Analysis
Abstract:
Behavioral neuroscience research often faces challenges in data management, reproducibility, and scalability, particularly when analyzing complex mouse behavior data. Existing open-source solutions frequently lack intuitive graphical interfaces, limiting accessibility and adoption. To address this gap, we developed Mus1, an open-source, GUI-based software designed to streamline the collection, management, and analysis of mouse behavioral data. Mus1 integrates seamlessly with advanced AI-driven pose estimation tools such as DeepLabCut and Keypoint MoSeq, enabling consistent and reproducible analysis of behavioral assays including Novel Object Recognition (NOR) and Open Field (OF) tests.
Using data from Dr. Burkhead's Wilson Disease (WD) mouse model, we demonstrate Mus1's capability to consistently interpret and visualize movement data from CSV outputs, facilitating rapid identification of significant behavioral phenotypes. Our findings indicate that Mus1 effectively supports multiple data types and analysis methods, significantly reducing the complexity of managing large datasets and improving the reproducibility of behavioral analyses. Additionally, the plugin-based architecture of Mus1 allows seamless integration of emerging AI tools, such as DeepLabCut and Keypoint MoSeq, enabling continuous monitoring of model performance and inference quality.
This poster presents recent progress and methodological advancements in Mus1, including SSH and CSV-based project imports, which enhance the software's scalability and potential for widespread adoption. Ultimately, Mus1 aims to enable researchers to infer disease states from home-cage video recordings, providing a robust, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for behavioral neuroscience research.
